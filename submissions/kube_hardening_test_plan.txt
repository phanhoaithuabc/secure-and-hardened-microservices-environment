How will you test the changes?
Test the cluster is an example of testing in a non-production setting. It can be done bt using VM (virtual box...)
Wecan also run kube-bench to see what in FAIL and record all change in cluster.yaml file.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
When we apply and remidiate the changes, we should deploy monitoring system (prometheus...) or observation system (like jager...) 
to track and to be notified when something happen.  Again, we can test in a non-prodiuction to make sure of it. After done testing 
process, we can apply to production.
