1. Incident commander name: Phan Hoai Thu

2. Executive Summary of what happened: 
The K8s cluster is injected by the attacker and thay deploy 3 crypto miners pod in it.

3. Summary of what was affected:
The attacker took control of our cluster, and thay deploy containers in it. Their purpose is wanting to get our cpmpute resources for
crypto-mining. This will cause our services slowly.

4. Summmry of the impact:
The cluster CPU usage spikes on top (about 95%) when attacker deploy those container. We can explore that by using Prometheus or Grafana.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
 - We can imidiately delete those pod out of the cluster by run command:
   kubectl delete pod/deployment/deamonset... <resources_name> --grace-period=0 --force
 - Check and limit admin access to resource
 - Set alert to notify when something bad happen again

6. Summary of lessons learned:
 - Always use least priviledge to restrict any body attempt to attack our resource.
 - Set mutiple alerts (RAM, CPU, Disk, Network, traffic...) to check and response with the situation ASAP.
